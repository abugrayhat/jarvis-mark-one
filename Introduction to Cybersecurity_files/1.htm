          <p>To protect an organization from every possible cyberattack 
is not feasible, for a few reasons. The expertise necessary to set up 
and maintain the secure network can be expensive. Attackers will always 
continue to find new ways to target networks. Eventually, an advanced 
and targeted cyberattack will succeed. The priority will then be how 
quickly your security team can respond to the attack to minimize the 
loss of data, downtime, and revenue. </p>
          <p>By now you know that anything posted online can live online
 forever, even if you were able to erase all the copies in your 
possession. If your servers were hacked, the confidential personnel 
information could be made public. A hacker (or hacking group) may 
vandalize the company website by posting untrue information and ruin the
 company’s reputation that took years to build. The hackers can also 
take down the company website causing the company to lose revenue. If 
the website is down for longer periods of time, the company may appear 
unreliable and possibly lose credibility. If the company website or 
network has been breached, this could lead to leaked confidential 
documents, revealed trade secrets, and stolen intellectual property. The
 loss of all this information may impede company growth and expansion. </p>
          <p>The monetary cost of a breach is much higher than just 
replacing any lost or stolen devices, investing in existing security and
 strengthening the building’s physical security. The company may be 
responsible for contacting all the affected customers about the breach 
and may have to be prepared for litigation. With all this turmoil, 
employees may choose to leave the company. The company may need to focus
 less on growing and more on repairing its reputation.</p>
